//    Note that since we’re starting our app after all javascript files have been loaded, and

//    waiting until the DOM is ready before starting, don’t forget to wrap the call to start in a
//    $(document).ready().

    // Calling the start() method fires the ContactManager.on("start", function () {}); located in app.js
